   description:
    - "Dr. Aguda is a multidisciplinary scientist who started his scientific career as a theoretical-physical chemist investigating the nonlinear dynamics of complex biochemical reaction systems, developing methods for predicting interaction network instabilities and the construction of predictive computational models. For the past 16 years, he has focused the applications of his methods to understanding how certain perturbations of gene & molecular interaction networks could lead to cancer."
    - "The ultimate goal of Dr. Aguda’s research program is the control of gene & molecular networks that are deregulated during malignant transformation.  He advocates the paradigm of network pharmacology that proposes targeting gene networks using combinations of drugs instead of the old one drug-one target strategy. At the Philippine Genome Center, one of the projects of his research group is the creation of network modules databases that serve, in association with novel computer algorithms being created by his group, as in silico platforms to aid in combination drug targets & disease biomarkers discovery."
